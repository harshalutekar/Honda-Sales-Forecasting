# Honda-Sales-Forecasting
The goal is to forecast the sales of upcoming 12 months based on the historical data of sales available. 
The initial changes that need to be done is converting the data into a time-series.
Further, plotting the time-series to checks for trends, patterns and seasonality. 
Also, calculating the Auto-correlation to check if there is any cohesive seasonality in the data. 
After determining all these, we run the different forecasting models to identify how the sales forecast unfold.
We will be using the following forecasting models for our Honda Sales data:
          1. Naive
          2. Mean
          3. Random Walk
          4. Snaive
          5. ETS
          6. HoltWinters
          7. Moving averages for degree 3,6,12.
 The accuracy of the forecasting models will be determined by using the MAPE measure which provides the error percentages for the models.
